INSTALLATION
============

Untar the downloaded file (e.g. tar xzvf Pyontapi-NNN.tar.gz, where NNN is
the version number of the latest release). If you’re using Windows, you can
download the command-line tool bsdtar to do this, or you can use a GUI-based
tool such as 7-zip.

Change into the directory created in step 2 (e.g. cd Pyontapi-NNN).

If you’re using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter the command
    sudo python setup.py install
at the shell prompt. If you’re using Windows, start up a command shell with
administrator privileges and run the command:
    setup.py install
