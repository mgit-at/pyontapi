   httplib.

   file structure.

 * Copyright adjusted to 2012

Version 0.2.2
=============

 * Role based connections: You are now able to define roles for your filers.
   Note: You need to update your NA_CONFIG settings dict as explained in the
   documentation.

Version 0.2.1
=============

 * Pyontapi now supports the new NetApp cluster mode.

 * Pyontapi is now ready for Python > 3. Therefor, the unicode support of
   Pyontapi for Python < 3.0 was dropped. Thus, all attributes and fields
   which contain only text are of type str (for both, Python 3 and 2).

 * Pyontapi nomore generates python code since this resulted in a blow-up of
   the api/ subfolder. Pyontapi now creates all methods for API commands
   at startup. The API commands can be invoked the usual way:

   >>> from schtob.pyontapi import NaFiler
   >>> result = filer.snapshot.list_info(volume='vol0')

   The only difference is that the API commands (like list_info) only accept
   keyword arguments. Default values will be handled internally.

   >>> def list_info(**kwargs):
       ...

 * The pyontapi_setup.py command was removed. Configuration should be done
   manually.
